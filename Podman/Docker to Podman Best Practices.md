# Best Practices Guide: Transitioning Secure Docker Apps to Podman

## 1. Introduction
This guide outlines best practices for migrating highly secure Docker container applications to Podman. It covers key considerations, steps, and security measures to ensure a smooth transition.

## 2. Pre-Migration Assessment
- [Inventory all Docker images, containers, and volumes](https://github.com/preska/RedHat/blob/main/Podman/2.1%20Inventory%20Docker%20Assets)
- Document current Docker configurations and dependencies
- Identify Docker-specific features in use
- Assess current security measures and policies

## 3. Podman Installation and Setup
- Install Podman on development and production environments
- Configure Podman for rootless operation (recommended for security)
- Set up user namespaces for rootless containers

## 4. Image Compatibility
- Test Docker images with Podman
- Address any compatibility issues
- Consider rebuilding images using Podman for optimized performance

## 5. Container Configuration
- Convert Docker run commands to Podman syntax
- Adjust volume mounts and persistent storage configurations
- Update network configurations to align with Podman's CNI-based networking

## 6. Security Enhancements
- Implement rootless containers where possible
- Review and update SELinux/AppArmor policies
- Use Podman's built-in security features (e.g., --security-opt seccomp=profile.json)
- Implement user namespace remapping for enhanced isolation

## 7. Orchestration and Compose
- Transition from Docker Compose to Podman Compose or Kubernetes manifests
- Update orchestration scripts and configurations

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Modify CI/CD pipelines to use Podman commands
- Update build and deployment scripts
- Implement Podman in automated testing environments

## 9. Monitoring and Logging
- Adjust monitoring tools to work with Podman's architecture
- Update log collection methods if necessary
- Implement Podman-specific health checks

## 10. Performance Tuning
- Optimize Podman settings for your specific workloads
- Conduct performance testing and compare with Docker benchmarks
- Address any performance discrepancies

## 11. Documentation and Training
- Update all relevant documentation to reflect Podman usage
- Provide training sessions for development and operations teams
- Create quick reference guides for common Podman tasks

## 12. Gradual Migration Strategy
- Start with non-critical applications
- Migrate applications in phases, testing thoroughly at each stage
- Maintain ability to rollback to Docker if issues arise

## 13. Post-Migration Validation
- Conduct thorough security audits of the new Podman environment
- Perform penetration testing to identify any new vulnerabilities
- Validate that all application functionalities work as expected

## 14. Ongoing Maintenance
- Keep Podman and related tools updated
- Regularly review and update security policies
- Stay informed about Podman best practices and new features

## 15. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- List of common migration issues and their solutions
- Resources for further Podman troubleshooting

## 16. Additional Resources
- Official Podman documentation
- Community forums and support channels
- Relevant books and online courses
