# Best Practices Guide: Transitioning Secure Docker Apps to Podman

## 1. Introduction
This guide outlines best practices for migrating highly secure Docker container applications to Podman. It covers key considerations, steps, and security measures to ensure a smooth transition.

## 2. Pre-Migration Assessment

The pre-migration assessment is a crucial first step in transitioning from Docker to Podman. This phase helps you understand your current Docker environment and identify potential challenges in the migration process.

### 2.1 Inventory Docker Assets
- Create a comprehensive list of all Docker images:
  - Document image names and tags
  - Note the source of each image (public repositories, private registries)
  - Identify custom-built images and their build processes
- Catalog all running and stopped containers:
  - Document container names, associated images, and runtime configurations
  - Note any containers running in privileged mode or with special permissions
- List all Docker volumes and their usage:
  - Identify named volumes and bind mounts
  - Document volume drivers in use

### 2.2 Document Current Docker Configurations
- Export and save Docker daemon configurations
- Document any custom network configurations:
  - List all custom networks and their drivers
  - Note any specific IP address assignments or port mappings
- Identify and document resource constraints (CPU, memory limits)
- List all environment variables used in containers
- Document any Docker secrets or configs in use

### 2.3 Identify Docker-Specific Features
- Review use of Docker-specific commands or APIs in your applications
- Identify any Docker plugins or extensions in use
- Note usage of Docker Compose and associated yaml files
- Document any Docker Swarm configurations if applicable
- List any Docker-specific health checks or auto-healing mechanisms

### 2.4 Assess Current Security Measures
- Review current container security policies:
  - Document SELinux or AppArmor profiles in use
  - List any seccomp profiles applied to containers
- Identify how root access is managed within containers
- Document current image scanning and vulnerability assessment processes
- Review network security measures:
  - List any network isolation techniques in use
  - Document firewall rules related to container traffic
- Assess secrets management:
  - How are sensitive data and credentials currently handled?
  - Document any external secret management tools integrated with Docker

### 2.5 Analyze Application Dependencies
- Identify inter-container dependencies and communication patterns
- Document how applications interact with the Docker daemon
- List any host system dependencies required by containers

### 2.6 Review Monitoring and Logging
- Document current monitoring solutions for containers and hosts
- Identify logging mechanisms:
  - How are container logs collected and stored?
  - Note any log rotation or aggregation techniques

### 2.7 Evaluate CI/CD Integration
- Review how Docker is integrated into your CI/CD pipelines
- Document automated build and deployment processes involving Docker

### 2.8 Assess Team Knowledge and Skills
- Evaluate team's familiarity with container technologies beyond Docker
- Identify any knowledge gaps that may need addressing for Podman adoption

### 2.9 Create Migration Checklist
- Based on the assessment, create a detailed checklist of items to address during migration
- Prioritize critical components and potential risk areas

### 2.10 Estimate Resource Requirements
- Assess the time and effort required for the migration
- Identify any additional tools or resources needed for the transition

This comprehensive pre-migration assessment will provide a solid foundation for planning your transition to Podman, helping to identify potential challenges and ensuring that all aspects of your current Docker environment are considered in the migration process.

## 3. Podman Installation and Setup
- Install Podman on development and production environments
- Configure Podman for rootless operation (recommended for security)
- Set up user namespaces for rootless containers

## 4. Image Compatibility
- Test Docker images with Podman
- Address any compatibility issues
- Consider rebuilding images using Podman for optimized performance

## 5. Container Configuration
- Convert Docker run commands to Podman syntax
- Adjust volume mounts and persistent storage configurations
- Update network configurations to align with Podman's CNI-based networking

## 6. Security Enhancements
- Implement rootless containers where possible
- Review and update SELinux/AppArmor policies
- Use Podman's built-in security features (e.g., --security-opt seccomp=profile.json)
- Implement user namespace remapping for enhanced isolation

## 7. Orchestration and Compose
- Transition from Docker Compose to Podman Compose or Kubernetes manifests
- Update orchestration scripts and configurations

## 8. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Modify CI/CD pipelines to use Podman commands
- Update build and deployment scripts
- Implement Podman in automated testing environments

## 9. Monitoring and Logging
- Adjust monitoring tools to work with Podman's architecture
- Update log collection methods if necessary
- Implement Podman-specific health checks

## 10. Performance Tuning
- Optimize Podman settings for your specific workloads
- Conduct performance testing and compare with Docker benchmarks
- Address any performance discrepancies

## 11. Documentation and Training
- Update all relevant documentation to reflect Podman usage
- Provide training sessions for development and operations teams
- Create quick reference guides for common Podman tasks

## 12. Gradual Migration Strategy
- Start with non-critical applications
- Migrate applications in phases, testing thoroughly at each stage
- Maintain ability to rollback to Docker if issues arise

## 13. Post-Migration Validation
- Conduct thorough security audits of the new Podman environment
- Perform penetration testing to identify any new vulnerabilities
- Validate that all application functionalities work as expected

## 14. Ongoing Maintenance
- Keep Podman and related tools updated
- Regularly review and update security policies
- Stay informed about Podman best practices and new features

## 15. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- List of common migration issues and their solutions
- Resources for further Podman troubleshooting

## 16. Additional Resources
- Official Podman documentation
- Community forums and support channels
- Relevant books and online courses
